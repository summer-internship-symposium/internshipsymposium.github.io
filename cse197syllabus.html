                            the EASy request for CSE 197 will be routed to obtain the appropriate approvals: 
                            typically the instructor and the Department approvals are required;
                            if a student doesn't meet the course requirements (minimum GPA 2.5 and at least 90 units), 
                            or if adding CSE 197 would cause student to exceed unit limits (4 units of Special Studies per quarter 
                            and 22 units total per quarter) then college approval is also required.
                            If approved, the Office of the Registrar will enroll students in the course. 
                            The student will be notified via email that they have been approved to enroll.
                            Make sure to enroll for the class <b>P/NP</b> ; students who complete the course 
                            successfully and enroll for a letter grade will be assigned a B by default.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Once you are notified by the CSE Student Affairs and/or Prof. Minnes that your application has been approved, 
                            you will be considered part of the CSE 197 cohort (regardless of when you officially add CSE 197 to your

                <h1>CSE 197 Course Requirements</h1>
                <h2>Course Overview</h2>
                <p>Through CSE 197, you will identify and deepen the connections between your UC San Diego 
                    coursework and real world problems.  You will also reflect on the growth of your professional, 
                    problem-solving, and technical skills over the internship. You will 
                    share your experiences with other student interns 
                    and discuss multiple perspectives in groups. The goal is that sharing these experiences communally 
                    will enhance each of your internships.</p>

                <p>Each weekly post should have <b>quick notes</b> (bullet points are fine) 
                    and a <b>deeper reflection</b> (at least 300 words, but more is fine). 
                    Keep your posts well-organized and easy to read. The title of each post should include your name, 
                    group name, and the week number.  (See <a href="#assignments">Assignments</a> for a description of your group name.)
                    The last weekly post has a special prompt and should be titled <b>Last week</b>.</p>
        
                <p>Every week, you'll also read your group members' posts.  Pick at least two posts and respond to 
                    them with specific questions: what do you want to know more about, and why? 
                </p>

                <p>Near the completion of your internship, you will prepare a poster highlighting key achievements
                    of your internship. These posters will be presented at the <a href="./index.html">Summer Internship Symposium</a> during
                    Fall Quarter.</p>

                <p>In your writing in this course, be honest, empathetic, and analytical about your experiences.
                <dl>
                    <dt>Honest</dt> <dd>Be truthful about your experiences and your reactions to these experiences.</dd>
                    <dt>Empathetic</dt> <dd>Listen openly to the experiences of others and offer your support.</dd>
                    <dt>Analytical</dt> <dd>Go deep with your reflections and look for (perhaps surprising or unexpected) connections.</dd>
                </dl>
                </p>

                <p>You need to read, understand, and follow the instructions here in order to pass the class. There may 
                    not be warnings during the term if you are not on track to satisfy all requirements.</p>

                <h2>Learning Goals</h2>
                By the end of CSE 197 students will have demonstrated the ability to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Select appropriate techniques from their coursework to solve real world problems.</li>
                    <li>Apply their coursework to solve real world problems in the real world.</li>
                    <li>Identify their personal areas of strength and weakness in solving real world problems.</li>
                    <li>Work effectively as a member of a large project team.</li>
                    <li>Identify resources for solving problems that arise, and then independently solve these problems.</li>
                    <li>Communicate effectively in written form about technical problems and solutions.</li>
                    <li>Demonstrate professional and ethical behavior.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Required Activities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>When you are hired for your internship, apply to join CSE 197 (<a href="#Apply">Link to application</a>). </li>
                    <li><b>Before</b> your first day, complete the Week 0 assignment (<a href="#assignments">Link to assignments</a>).</li>
                    <li>At the end of each workday, make a short diary entry (reflection) on your activities. 
                        You will  not be posting these entries publicly, though I may ask to see them at some point. 
                        As you write, pay special attention to: what knowledge you applied from your UC San Diego education;
                        problems, frustrations, successes, key moments; any professional or ethical dilemmas.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the end of each week (e.g., Friday afternoon or evening), write and post a reflection for the 
                        week (at least 350 words), following the weekly prompts.
                    </li>
                    <li>Read the other posted reflections by Monday morning. For at least two of your group members, 
                        pose a question to the writer of the reflection: what would you like to hear more about in 
                        what they described? Why?  You might also offer a thoughtful comment on how their experience 
                        resonated or contrasted with your own. <b>Note: since you and your group members may have 
                            different internship start dates, you may be responding to different  prompts each week.  
                            That's ok! Use the comments and  followups to engage in discussions about your shared experiences.
                        </b>
                    </li>
                    <li>At the end of the term you will prepare a poster highlighting special achievements over 
                        your internship.  Depending on your enrolment and other circumstances, you will either present 
                        your poster at the Summer Internship Symposium during Fall quarter OR you 
                        will prepare a written alternative final assignment for the course.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <a name="FAQ"></a>
                <h2>Minimum Passing Threshold</h2>
                <p>This class is offered P/NP only (no letter grade option*). To pass the course, you must pass each 
                    of the following required components: 
                    <dl>
                    <dt>Professional behavior</dt> 
                    <dd><p>All supporting documentation is submitted promptly, 
                        assignments are submitted on time, work presented is consistent with the UC San Diego policy 
                        on academic integrity (in particular, information shared about the internship experience 
                        is truthful and also respectful of any professional obligations for nondisclosure).</p>
                        <p>Any violations of academic integrity or company nondisclosure agreements will result in failing the class.
                        </p>
                        <p>  Initial logistics: If your week 0 post is not complete and on Piazza within one week 
                        of your start date, you cannot pass the class.</p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Weekly reflections and group discussions</dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>Work is thoughtful, respectful, and satisfies all criteria laid out in the assignments.</p>
                        <p>Daily reflections: You must spend at least 5 minutes reflecting on your internship 
                            on at least 50% of the work days of your internship.  
                            Dishonest or incorrect reporting of the time spent on these reflections is 
                            considered a violation of academic integrity in this class.</p>
                        <p>Slip days for weekly reflections: Weekly reflections are due each week of your 
                            internship on Sunday 11:59pm anywhere on Earth.  
                            Over the duration of your internship, you may use up to 
                            3*(number of weeks in your internship) slip days from these deadlines. 
                        <p>For example, for a 10 week internship, if you post all of your weekly reflections on 
                            time for the first 8 weeks, you may post the last two weeks' reflections up to one month late.</p>
                        <p>Alternatively, during a 12 week internship, you may routinely post your weekly reflection on 
                            Monday instead of Sunday evening and still have a few slip days left over. 
                            Other configurations are okay, so long as they don't exceed the slip day allotment.
                        </p>
                        <p>You must submit each weekly reflection, even if it is late. 
                            Slip days will continue to accrue on an assignment past its deadline and until it is submitted.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Final assignment</dt><dd>Summer Internship Symposium poster or alternative assignment satisfies all required 
                    criteria, as does attendance and presentation at the Symposium and completion of required forms.</dd>
                    </dl>
                </p>
                <p>*If a letter grade needs to be assigned, the default passing grade used will be a B.  
                    Check with TritonLink to make sure you enroll as P/NP.</p>

                <h2>Course Credit</h2>
                <p>A student may earn 4 units of elective credit once for CSE 197. 
                    To earn credit for CSE 197 the student must be engaged in an approved 
                    full-time, on site/remote/hybrid internship and supervised by a faculty member 
                    following the approved syllabus. Students may not earn elective credit for CSE 197 with a 
                    part-time or short-term internship.</p>

                <p>Students with Summer internships may enroll for CSE 197 either in the 
                    Special Summer Session or in the Fall Quarter. 
                    Students  with  CPT requirements must enroll in CSE 197 concurrently with their internship.
                    Regardless, the work for CSE 197 will be coupled with the Summer internship and the 
                    bulk of CSE 197 must be completed while on-site at the internship. 
                </p>

                            If your company has concerns about your participation in the course, I can work with them to look for

                            However, it is possible that some companies will disallow their interns 
                            from sharing any information about the internship experience; in such a situation,

                            be extremely careful about you share about your plans and company on Piazza until you clear it.  
                            You must have your company's permission to participate in this course before the end

                        <p>Each week, you will share your reflections and experiences with other students in CSE 197.  
                            You can pick your own group members: groups should have three to ten members.  
                            To find teammates, you can read other students' introduction notes on Piazza, and/or
                            use Piazza's "Find a Teammate" post, and/or
                            form a group with people you already know who are taking the class this term.
                        </p>
                        <p>Once you have your group, decide on a group name.  Each group member needs to fill 
                            out this form to officially join the group: <a href="https://forms.gle/XwBvTtuL3uipuZqg6">https://forms.gle/XwBvTtuL3uipuZqg6</a> </p>

                        <p>If new members join a group after some members have already submitted the form, the 
                            new members should submit the form with the updated group information. The original 
                            members of the group do not need to resubmit the form.

                <h2>Posters: Requirements and Resources</h2>
                <p>Your poster should sum up your key lessons learned at the internship and engage or teach your audience. 
                    The audience for your poster includes: your peers in CSE 197, first- and second-year CSE majors who want to learn about internships, 
                    your CSE professors, and industry professionals. Design your poster so that it speaks to each one of these groups. 
                    Incorporate text and graphics in your poster to make it visually appealing.</p>

                <p>If you created a poster as part of your internship, you might be able to reuse some of the poster text. 
                    But, you must also address specific UC San Diego connections to answer all of the questions below. 
                    We will print this poster for you if you participate in the Summer Internship Symposium.</p>
