<h2>Alumni Panel</h2>
<p>The alumni panel is an opportunity for current students to hear about alumni experiences related to internships. 
    Some of the students in the audience will have just completed an internship. Others will be looking for internships for 
    next summer or beyond. The goal of the panel is to help students feel empowered and to recognize the many different
    experiences (good and bad) that can be part of the journey from school to career.</p>
