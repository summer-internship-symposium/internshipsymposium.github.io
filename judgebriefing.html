The role of the faculty judge is to speak with approximately 5-10 students who have prepared 3 minutes of highlights 
in one of three tracks, and select a winner and an honorable mention for each track in each of the two sessions.

<ul>
<li>Technical Skills (TS). Criteria: Goal, technical challenges, and personal contributions clearly communicated.</li>
<li>Personal and professional growth (PPG). Criteria: Lessons learned are useful, actionable, and illustrated with specific personal experiences.</li>
<li>Ethics & Society (ES). Criteria: Impact described is positive, specific to the summer project or subfield in which you worked, and is significant.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
    There will be multiple judges for each track and session; please use the time between 3:20 and 3:50 to compare
    notes and jointly decide on winder and honorable mention. You can use CSE 1241 for these deliberations.
