# internshipsymposium.github.io

This repository:
* Stores HTML/CSS/images for the UC San Diego CSE Summer Internship Symposium website
* Automatically deploys to [https://summer-internship-symposium.github.io/internshipsymposium.github.io/](https://summer-internship-symposium.github.io/internshipsymposium.github.io/) on commit and push to the repository
* Can be *manually* deployed to [https://internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu](https://internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu) by using Actions -> Deploy to internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu -> Run Workflow (from main branch)

## Editing
You can edit the HTML/CSS/images directly through the Github editing interfaces. When you commit/save, you will be able to see your changes reflected in [https://summer-internship-symposium.github.io/internshipsymposium.github.io/](https://summer-internship-symposium.github.io/internshipsymposium.github.io/) a few minutes later. It's also fine to clone and edit locally and push later, but for quick updates the web interface on Github is particularly convenient, especially if the goal is to just fix up some typos, etc.

The site is completely built in HTML and CSS, and there is no build system â€“ it's just the files you see. As more pages get added it may be worth adding a build system to share a common header, etc. The Bootstrap CSS library is directly copied/hosted in the repository, which is the main exernal dependency for layout.

The [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/) elements that are used are: grid (rows and columns), nav, and carousel. The media queries in symposium.css are designed around specific widths for the title.

## Deploying
The script in [.github/workflows](.github/workflows) is responsible for copying the files to [https://internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu](https://internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu) when we trigger the action. It has a SSH key for the internshipsymposium user stored as a repository secret, and uses scp to copy and overwrite all the files in the relevant target directory on that host.

UPDATE: UCSD OEC no longer allows copying files to their servers from off-campus sources. GitHub Actions use off-campus sources for this script so it no longer works.

Instead: in a local Terminal while on UCSD networks, run 

scp -r ./* internshipsymposium@internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu:~/htdocs/

and use server password for internshipsymposium@internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu

### Understanding [.github/workflows/main.yml](.github/workflows/main.yml): 
The environment variables are set so that files can be copied to the internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu server automatically
(without entering the password each time). To set this up, a public/private rsa key pair is needed.
1. Locally (e.g. in Terminal), run `ssh-keygen` and (when prompted) enter full path for file to save key e.g. `/Users/username/.ssh/sis_rsa`  and do not enter a passphrase (so that action can run without user input)
2. Copy the public key to a line in the `authorized_keys` file in internshipsymposium@internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu, e.g. using FTP with the command `put /Users/username/.ssh/sis_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized keys`
3. Store the private key as an Actions secret: navigate to Settings --> Secrets --> Actions and select "New repository secret" and copy the contents of sis_rsa to the secret.  The name of this secret is stored in the Github Action environment variable SIS_SSH_KEY on line 25.
4. Locally (e.g. in Terminal), generate the key signatures of the internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu host by running `ssh-keyscan internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu`. The non-commented lines that are printed by this command are stored in the Github Action environment variable KNOWN_HOSTS on lines 27-29.
5. The Github Action runs by copying the private key to a file in the repo (line 31), copying the signatures of the host (line 33), setting permissions to use the private key (line 33), and then using `scp` to copy all the files for the website using the private key to authenticate (line 34).

To deploy, use the Actions interface, selecting `Deploy to internshipsymposium.ucsd.edu` and clicking the button `Run workflow`, `Use workflow from Branch: main`, `Run workflow`.
