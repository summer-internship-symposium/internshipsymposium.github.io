<p>

You will present your work to faculty/alumni judges, fellow students, and industry mentors during one of the two session times. 
</p>

<p>
    Prepare a 3 minute elevator pitch to address the criteria for your category, and then be prepared to answer questions about your project. 
</p>

<p>
Prizes and honorable mentions will be awarded by faculty/alumni judges in each category in each session.
<ul>
<li>Technical Skills (TS). Criteria: Goal, technical challenges, and personal contributions clearly communicated.</li>
<li>Personal and professional growth (PPG). Criteria: Lessons learned are useful, actionable, and illustrated with specific personal experiences.</li>
<li>Ethics & Society (ES). Criteria: Impact described is positive, specific to the summer project or subfield in which you worked, and is significant.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Light refreshments will be served. You are welcome to invite your friends, classmates, and faculty mentors. Invitations were sent out to your industry mentors (based on the contact information you shared at the start of the summer); if you'd like to invite additional faculty guests, please let me know.
</p>
<p>
Please check in to receive your name tag and find your poster at least 30 minutes before the start of the Symposium.

You are expected to stay for the entire duration of the Symposium. 
You will be presenting your poster during half of the time, and listening to your peers present their posters during the other half.
</p>
<p>
The Symposium dress-code is business casual.
